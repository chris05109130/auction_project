Welcome to my SASS Project, Called Auction Block

This was my very first project where I used a framework of CSS which is SASS. Basically its just a complier meaning you write the code more efficently and then it complies it into css. Basically help keep the code more organized. 

So this project I decided to go with a fake auction web site. This site is a one page project just like acouple other projects that I have. On the project it list basically a way you might see an auction site if you were ever to go on one by using the internet.
